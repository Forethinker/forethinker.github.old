	<p>Book-taught negotiation skill and in-practice negotiation are different ball-game. The book you buy from Amazon, despite its wisdom and anecdotes, fails to address the context that you are in. Yes, it is good to read one, but knowing the value of what you can offer and your alternatives or calculating the risks on a spot is a skill that is difficult to acquire.</p>
<p>So no, I can't teach you to acquire that skill, but just tell you my experience. First time out of college, I called for a 6-figure income. I high balled quite bit and I thought the company …</p>

	<p>I began to hear this term since college. From my experience, it was used as an excuse for something or just a attempt to gain sympathy from peers (who doesn't want to play victim?). I was reading a post by an investment banker on Quora who confessed to become wealthy at the cost of having no life. He was trying to send a message that money is not everything, but that got me thinking... do I have a life? I do not watch TV or video games, but the only place I go on weekends is church.

I managed to get better services and find my way in Los Angeles downtown with my rusty Spanish, but I never had to speak the language in social settings or at work.

	<p>In my <a href="pages/aboutme.html">aboutme page</a>, I say I am a lifehacker graduate. There is a profound meaning in those words. Back in 2008, when lifehacker.com was gaining a greater public attraction, I was there. I subscribed to their RSS feed and went through most of the articles for almost three years. I became more knowledgeable and wiser with each article, but it also cost me a great deal of time. Now their articles seem recycled to me and now I see that they are not the most efficient ways to get things done.

	<p>There are designs that are useful, and there are designs that are unnecessary. When desiging something, let each element have a purpose and serve it well. Making a "in-between" design might make it a good marketing-gimick, but it will end up being a waste of time. Yes there is an exception to this rule, like a big phone, but I think it is very difficult to make the case for desktop customization.
