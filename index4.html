	<p>My company is forcing me to use CentOS. I was in a state of shock for a few days and pretend it did not happen, but I have to live with it. Here are the fixes I had to go through:</p>
<h2>The permission on ~/.ssh</h2>
<p>This seems to be a bit more strict. I had to set ~/.ssh permission to 600 and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to <code>700</code> to make <code>ssh-copy-id</code> to make it work</p>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<h2>Allowing to run commands as sudo</h2>
<p>e.g. <code>sudo vim /etc/profile</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo bash -c &quot;echo &#39;%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       SETENV: ALL&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/sudoer&quot;
